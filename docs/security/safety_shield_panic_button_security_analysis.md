## Critical Findings Summary

| Severity | Count | CVSS Range | Primary Issues |
|----------|-------|------------|----------------|
| Critical | 5 | 8.1-9.5 | Insecure Token Storage, Weak Cryptography, Dependency Vulnerabilities, CSP Bypass, GitHub Dependencies |
| High | 6 | 7.0-8.0 | Client-Side Data Exposure, XSS Vulnerabilities, Native Code Security, Location Privacy, Plugin Security, Session Management |

## Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Insecure Authentication Token Storage (CRITICAL)

**Risk Level:** Critical  
**CVSS Score:** 9.5

**Description:**
Authentication tokens and sensitive user data are stored in unencrypted HTML5 localStorage in a mobile environment, making them accessible to any JavaScript code and persistent across app sessions without proper protection.

**Evidence:**
- **Location**: `src/data/SavedData.ts`, line 3
- **Code Example**:
```typescript
export default class SavedData {
    storage: Storage = window.localStorage;
    
    constructor($id: string, $defaultData: any) {
        let strData: string | null = this.storage.getItem(this.storageID);
        if (strData) {
            this.data = JSON.parse(strData);
        }
    }
}
```

**Mobile-Specific Risks:**
- Device theft with persistent token access
- Mobile malware accessing localStorage
- Cross-app data access on compromised devices
- Backup/restore exposing tokens
- Debug mode token exposure

**Impact:**
- Complete account takeover on device theft
- Persistent session hijacking across app restarts
- Unauthorized emergency system access
- Potential false emergency reporting
- Location data exposure

**Recommendations:**
- **Immediate**: Migrate to secure mobile storage (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)
- **Short-term**: Implement token encryption before localStorage storage
- **Long-term**: Use secure session management with automatic expiration and device binding

### 2. Weak Cryptographic Implementation (CRITICAL)

**Risk Level:** Critical  
**CVSS Score:** 9.2

**Description:**
The application uses MD5 and SHA1 hashing algorithms for authentication validation, both of which are cryptographically broken and vulnerable to collision attacks, particularly dangerous in a mobile emergency communication context.

**Evidence:**
- **Location**: `src/api/Api.ts`, getAuthBlock method and `src/util/HashUtil.ts`
- **Code Example**:
```typescript
getAuthBlock($includeAssetTokens: boolean = true) {
    let timestamp: number = Date.now();
    let sequenceNum: string = HashUtil.sha1(this.strIdentifier);
    let text: string = sequenceNum + (timestamp % 10000);
    let validation: string = HashUtil.md5(text);
    // ... rest of auth block construction
}
```

**Mobile Emergency Context:**
- Emergency communications require highest security standards
- Predictable authentication in life-safety scenarios
- Potential for malicious emergency reports
- Risk of interfering with actual emergency response

**Impact:**
- Authentication bypass through hash collision attacks
- Predictable validation tokens
- Replay attack vulnerabilities
- False emergency activation
- Compromise of emergency communication integrity

**Recommendations:**

- **Short-term**: Implement proper HMAC for message authentication
- **Long-term**: Migrate to JWT tokens with RS256 signing and mobile-specific claims

### 3. Extensive GitHub Dependencies Vulnerability (CRITICAL)

**Risk Level:** Critical  
**CVSS Score:** 8.8

**Description:**
The application relies on 15+ custom forked Cordova plugins hosted on GitHub repositories, creating significant supply chain security risks with unverified code execution in a mobile environment.

**Evidence:**
- **Location**: `source-cordova-12/package.json`
- **Vulnerable Dependencies**:
```json
{
  "@havesource/cordova-plugin-push": "github:Intrado/Cordova_Laaser_push",
  "call-number": "github:Intrado/Cordova_CallNumberPlugin",
  "com-sarriaroman-photoviewer": "github:Intrado/Cordova_Photoviewer",
  "com.unarin.cordova.beacon": "github:Intrado/cordova-plugin-ibeacon",
  "cordova_plugin_audiorecorder": "github:Intrado/Cordova_Plugin_AudioRecorder",
  "cordova-custom-config": "github:Intrado/Cordova_CustomConfig"
  // ... 10+ more GitHub dependencies
}
```

**Mobile-Specific Risks:**

**Evidence:**
- **Location**: `source-react-18/public/index.html`
- **Code Example**:
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
default-src * data: blob: gap: intradoss: ; 
style-src * 'unsafe-inline';
script-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; 
media-src * 'unsafe-inline'; 
img-src * 'self' data: content:;">
```

**Mobile Security Implications:**
