## Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Insecure Authentication Token Storage (CRITICAL)

**Risk Level:** Critical  
**CVSS Score:** 9.2

**Description:**
Authentication tokens and sensitive user data are stored in unencrypted HTML5 localStorage, making them accessible to any JavaScript code and persistent across browser sessions.

**Evidence:**
- **Location**: `src/data/SavedData.ts`, line 3
- **Code Example**:
```typescript
export default class SavedData {
    storage: Storage = window.localStorage;
    
    constructor($id: string, $defaultData: any) {
        let strData: string | null = this.storage.getItem(this.storageID);
        if (strData) {
            this.data = JSON.parse(strData);
        }
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Token theft via XSS attacks
- Persistent session hijacking
- Cross-tab token access
- No token expiration on browser close
- Data accessible to malicious browser extensions

**Recommendations:**
- **Immediate**: Migrate to httpOnly cookies for token storage
- **Short-term**: Implement token encryption before localStorage storage
- **Long-term**: Use secure session management with automatic expiration

### 2. Weak Cryptographic Implementation (CRITICAL)

**Risk Level:** Critical  
**CVSS Score:** 8.9

**Description:**
The application uses MD5 and SHA1 hashing algorithms for authentication validation, both of which are cryptographically broken and vulnerable to collision attacks.

**Evidence:**
- **Location**: `src/api/Api.ts`, getAuthBlock method
- **Code Example**:
```typescript
getAuthBlock($includeAssetTokens: boolean = true) {
    let timestamp: number = Date.now();
    let sequenceNum: string = HashUtil.sha1(this.strIdentifier);
    let text: string = sequenceNum + (timestamp % 10000);
    let validation: string = HashUtil.md5(text);
    // ... rest of auth block construction
}
```

**Impact:**
- Authentication bypass through hash collision attacks
- Predictable validation tokens
- Replay attack vulnerabilities
- Weak session validation

**Recommendations:**
- **Immediate**: Replace MD5/SHA1 with SHA-256 or stronger algorithms
- **Short-term**: Implement proper HMAC for message authentication
- **Long-term**: Migrate to JWT tokens with RS256 signing

### 3. Dependency Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)
