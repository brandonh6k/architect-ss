# PI Planning 2025.2 Retrospective:

## What went well:
Despite it being long, I think spreading PI Planning across 4 days made a lot of sense instead of trying to cram it all into 2-3 days and risking burnout.

## What didn't go well:
### ART Structure
One monster ART meant that for a lot of people, 80% of the content covered was completely worthless and a waste of time, leading to disengagement. This is a significant regression from our previous model where ARTs were structured around Lines of Business (LOB), which ensured teams working on similar products could effectively collaborate and share relevant information.

### Process and Tool Misalignment
Forcing our process to map to what a tool supports is dumb (e.g., shadow sprints for Kanban teams). This is completely at odds with the Agile Manifesto (Individuals & Interactions over Processes & Tools).

The fundamental issue here is that we've never fully committed to agile transformation. Instead, we've merely layered Scrum/SAFe ceremonies on top of our existing waterfall SDLC without doing the hard work of truly adopting agile principles.

### Planning Metrics Issues
Utilization of hours as a planning metric - beyond the fact that we've got teams large enough to have 1000+ hour "capacities" in a 2-week sprint and the tool doesn't support that, hours introduce a number of other issues that I don't feel Intrado is mature enough to recognize and deal with. For example:
- Hours introduce an implied precision that simply DOES NOT EXIST in software development or IT work
- This leads to these values being taken as commitments instead of forecasts
- Developer variance means hour estimates are inherently unreliable (different developers will take different amounts of time for the same task)

## What could be improved:

### 1. ART Structure Recommendations
- Return to LOB-based ART structure to ensure relevant content for all participants
- Create a separate model for handling Shared Services teams (Operations/SRE) that allows them to effectively support all ARTs while maintaining their own planning cadence
- Consider implementing a hybrid model where Shared Services can participate across ARTs as needed

### 2. Planning Metrics
- Transition from hours to story points for estimation
- Implement proper story point training to ensure consistent understanding across teams
- Focus on relative sizing rather than time-based estimates
- See: [Agile Estimation and Planning by Mike Cohn](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/books/agile-estimating-and-planning) for more details

### 3. Process Improvements
- Conduct an honest assessment of our current agile maturity
- Identify gaps between our current process and true agile principles
- Create a roadmap for genuine agile transformation rather than ceremonial adoption
- Consider bringing in external agile coaching to help with the transition
- Review tool selection after process clarification, not before

### 4. Cross-team Collaboration
- Implement a more flexible system for cross-team dependencies that doesn't rely solely on PI Planning
- Create clear channels for high-priority work requests outside of the PI Planning cycle
- Consider implementing a regular cadence of inter-team touchpoints outside of PI Planning

## Other comments:
While tools are necessary for a distributed company like ours (with two major locations and remote workers), we need to ensure that our process drives tool selection, not vice versa. The current setup suggests we're letting tools dictate our process, which is fundamentally backwards.

The current perception that teams won't consider work without an epic on their PI Planning board is concerning and indicates a rigid, ceremonial approach to agile rather than the flexibility and responsiveness that agile principles advocate for.
