# Clever Attendance Data Integration
> Implement integration with Clever's attendance data API to import student attendance records into Safety Shield

## Business Context
Safety Shield currently imports attendance data from PowerSchool for student tracking and school safety features. Clever has now provided a beta version of their attendance data API. We need to integrate with this API to support districts using Clever as their SIS provider, allowing them to benefit from the same attendance-related features currently available to PowerSchool users.

## Epic Goal
Successfully integrate with Clever's attendance data API to import attendance records, making them available to all existing Safety Shield features that utilize attendance data, with functional parity to our PowerSchool integration.

## User Impact
- Primary users: School administrators, safety personnel, and district SIS managers
- Current experience: Only districts using PowerSchool can leverage attendance data in Safety Shield
- Desired experience: Districts using Clever as their SIS can also leverage attendance data in Safety Shield with the same functionality

## Scope
### Key Features & Capabilities
- Create a helper application to poll Clever's attendance API on a configurable interval
- Transform the Clever attendance data into the existing CSV format used by PowerSchool
- Upload the formatted data into the existing Safety Shield import system
- Ensure all existing attendance-dependent features work with the Clever-sourced data
- Update relevant error messages and notifications to reference Clever when appropriate

### Out of Scope
- Modifications to how attendance data is consumed by the Safety Shield system
- Changes to the existing attendance data model or database schema
- Direct API integration that bypasses the CSV upload process
- New features or capabilities that utilize attendance data

## Success Metrics
- 100% of districts using Clever can successfully import attendance data into Safety Shield
- Zero regression in functionality for attendance-dependent features when using Clever data
- Attendance data latency from Clever to Safety Shield matches or improves upon PowerSchool integration

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Systems impacted: SIS import system, attendance tracking features
- External dependencies: Clever's beta attendance API, timeline for full API release
- Technical constraints: Must use existing CSV upload process and data formats
- Business constraints: Must be ready for PI2025.3 implementation

## Initial Story / Task Breakdown
1. Obtain and document Clever attendance API specifications
2. Create helper application to poll Clever Attendance API with configurable polling interval and error handling
3. Implement data transformation from Clever format to PowerSchool CSV format and upload to dataFileUpload API
4. Create comprehensive test suite for the integration
5. Update relevant documentation and support materials

## Risks & Assumptions
### Risks
- We do not currently have any specification or documentation on Clever's attendance data
- We are incurring technical debt by utilizing the existing CSV upload process instead of a direct API integration
- Beta API may change before final release, requiring rework
- Data structure differences between Clever and PowerSchool could require complex transformations

### Assumptions
- The schema for Clever will mirror (or closely mimic) the existing PowerSchool attendance data
- We will be polling Clever on a configurable interval set in the new helper app's configuration
- Clever's beta API will be stable enough for development and testing
- The final version of Clever's API will be released on schedule
